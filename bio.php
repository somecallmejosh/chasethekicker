      <p><strong>As a High School Senior, I am beginning to plan for college life</strong>. My goal is to find a school that offers a 
      great education and an opportunity to play football at the next level. I have worked hard the last three years 
      to prepare for this next step. I have attended many camps, and clocked hundreds of practice hours, while maintaining 
      a <strong>3.2 GPA</strong> and earning <strong>19 college credits</strong>. I will continue to work hard throughout this next season to do the best I can 
      for my team.</p>
