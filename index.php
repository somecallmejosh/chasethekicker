      <p>My name is <strong>Chase Briley</strong>. I haven't always been a kicker. I spent most of my time growing up 
      as a soccer player. Clearing balls on defense and taking corner kicks helped prepare me for another adventure. When I entered high school, soccer was no 
      longer available. I was given the chance to try out for kicker on the football team. It was a blessing in disguise. I love this game. 
      Here are some of my <a href="videos.php">kicking videos</a>.</p>
